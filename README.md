Last year, [Smart Columbus Open Data Enthusiats (SCODE)](https://www.scodemeetup.org/) was issued an [Open Design Challenge](https://github.com/SCODEMeetup/locator-jekyll/blob/release-v2.0/HACKABLE-SNACK.md). The challenge was to help people find and access
Community Services using data from the [Smart Columbus Operating System (SCOS)](https://www.smartcolumbusos.com/). SCODE members could build an interactive map, displaying locations of active service providers where users could navigate the map by location, service provider, and service offerings.

Below are the links are to the initial visualization submissions:
- [Heroku Locator](https://cbus-community-service-locator.herokuapp.com/)
- [Jupyter Notebook Locator](https://github.com/SCODEMeetup/community-services-locator-ui-2)

What follows are a collection of lessons learned from the SCODE teams and their members.

### Entity Relationship Diagram
The initial analysis started with looking at the files listed on the Open Design Challenge and understanding how they related to one another. The four comma-separated values(CSV) files are part of the [Food Pantry and User Data](https://ckan.smartcolumbusos.com/dataset/food-pantry-and-user-data) dataset on the SCOS. That dataset is provided by [HandsOn Central Ohio](https://handsoncentralohio.org/).

Last year, [Smart Columbus Open Data Enthusiats (SCODE)](https://www.scodemeetup.org/) was issued an [Open Design Challenge](https://github.com/SCODEMeetup/locator-jekyll/blob/release-v2.0/HACKABLE-SNACK.md). The challenge was to help people find and access
Community Services using data from the [Smart Columbus Operating System](https://www.smartcolumbusos.com/). SCODE members could build an interactive map, displaying locations of active service providers where users could navigate the map by location, service provider, and service offerings.

Below are the links are to the initial visualization submissions:
- [Heroku Locator](https://cbus-community-service-locator.herokuapp.com/)
- [Jupyter Notebook Locator](https://github.com/SCODEMeetup/community-services-locator-ui-2)

What follows are a collection of lessons learned from the SCODE teams and their members.
